We developed an application, IOCL VEHICLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, that allows the
administrator to register contract-based vehicles under IOCL and generate credentials for the driver
so that they can later log in from the driver app we developed. The transport officer can then track
the vehicles and calculate the distance the vehicles have travelled. This distance can be used to
calculate the vehicle's billing since billing is based on the distance travelled.

IOCL VSS is a MERN application. It has three main components
1. Admin Portal: Here the admin has the full permission to register a new vehicle into
the IOCL tracking system and can track the location of all the registered vehicles
2. Driver App: The driver just need to install the app and get credentials provided by the
Admin.
3. Backend : The backend server is implemented using Node Js ,Express and MongoDB
